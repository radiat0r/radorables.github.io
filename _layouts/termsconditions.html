			<p>RADORABLES Terms and Conditions (&ldquo;T&amp;C&rdquo;, &quot;Terms of Service&quot;, &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;)</p>
			<p>The RADORABLES Team are the creators / owners of the RADORABLES NFT collection and any reference herein to &quot;RADORABLES &quot;, the &quot;RADORABLES team&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, the &quot;Project&quot;, etc. will imply the RADORABLES Team. By reserving a RADORABLES NFT you are explicitly accepting these T&amp;C (with the proof of acceptance recorded in your order, which is publicly visible on the Radix distributed ledger).</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>RADORABLES is a collection of digital illustrations in the form of NFTs running on the Radix DLT Network. The RADORABLES website: www.radorables.com (the &quot;Site&quot;, &quot;website&quot;) is only an interface allowing participants to reserve digital collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Radix DLT Network wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval or engaging with us. Furthermore, as the RADORABLES smart contract will run on the Radix DLT Network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.</p>
			<p>This website and its connected services (including RADORABLES) are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; without warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving RADORABLES digital collectibles.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>1. Ownership</p>
			<p>1.1 General</p>
			<p>You own the NFT. Each RADORABLES NFT is an NFT on the Radix Network. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying RADORABLES NFT illustration completely. Ownership of the NFT will be mediated by the future Smart Contracts, a Radix NFT Marketplace and the Radix DLT Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any RADORABLES NFT (once it has been transmitted).</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>1.2 Personal use</p>
			<p>Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, The RADORABLES Team grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased NFT, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use and (ii) as part of a Marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your RADORABLES NFT (provided that the Marketplace is also compliant with our Terms).</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>1.3 Commercial use</p>
			<p>Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, The RADORABLES Team grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased NFT for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the NFT (&ldquo;Commercial Use&rdquo;) you own. Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the NFT to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the NFT. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a Marketplace that permits the use and sale of RADORABLES generally (provided that the Marketplace is also compliant with our Terms); or (ii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>1.4 The only limitation of use</p>
			<p>The only personal and / or commercial limitation of use of a RADORABLES NFT is if they are used in a defamatory, derogatory or highly immoral way, or in a way in which it causes / can cause direct negative consequences to the project (image or otherwise). In such cases we reserve the right to seek a remedy, to request a cease and desist, or other ways to effectively prevent the RADORABLES NFTs from being used in such ways.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>1.5 Ownership of The RADORABLES Team</p>
			<p>The intellectual property that involves RADORABLES and its brand, illustration, logo, website imagery etc. is owned by the RADORABLES Team. All rights that are not specifically granted to the users and owners of RADORABLES NFTs below are reserved by the RADORABLES Team. This includes but is not limited to the intellectual property rights surrounding the RADORABLES name, brand, logo, illustration layer files, design, look and feel of the RADORABLES, the website, the smart contract code, or anything else not specifically granted by any following licenses.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The RADORABLES Team other than the rights to the NFT, nothing herein gives you any rights to any other Trademarks or other intellectual property rights belonging to The RADORABLES Team including, without limitation, to the RADORABLES Team and RADORABLES, and the associated logos and illustrations. All of these rights are expressly reserved in the name of the RADORABLES Team.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>2. Prohibited uses / Your Obligations</p>
			<p>You are solely responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using this website, and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the website only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations. In addition to other prohibitions as set forth in the Terms of Service, you are prohibited from using the site or its content:</p>
			<p>(a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or participate in any unlawful acts; (c) to violate any international, federal, provincial or state regulations, rules, laws, or local ordinances; (d) to infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others; (e) to harass, abuse, insult, harm, defame, slander, disparage, intimidate, or discriminate based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, race, age, national origin, or disability; (f) to submit false or misleading information;</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>(g) to upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way that will affect the functionality or operation of the Service or of any related website, other websites, or the Internet; (h) to collect or track the personal information of others; (i) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; (j) for any obscene or immoral purpose; or (k) to interfere with or circumvent the security features of the Service or any related website, other websites, or the Internet.

			<p><br></p>
			<p>3. Transactions, fees &amp; Payment</p>
			<p>If you elect to purchase a RADORABLES NFT through the website, any financial / crypto transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Radix DLT Network. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage or any other transactions that you conduct via the Radix DLT Network.</p>
			<p>Radix DLT Network requires the payment of a transaction fee (a &ldquo;Gas Fee&rdquo;) for every transaction that occurs on the Radix DLT Network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Radix DLT Network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>4. RADORABLES are NOT an investment asset</p>
			<p>RADORABLES are collectible digital illustration pieces that also function as fun and NFTs for people to collect. They are created as such and intended for people to enjoy collecting (e.g., use as a profile picture, avatar, on their T-shirt, as a sticker, etc.). They are NOT a financial instrument, investment asset or anything equivalent / similar (no matter how it might be referred to in other jurisdictions). RADORABLES make absolutely no representations nor claim anything that can be perceived as &quot;value&quot; or &quot;investment&quot; related. You explicitly acknowledge that you make no expectations of &quot;yield&quot;, &quot;profit&quot;, &quot;investment&quot; by reserving a RADORABLES NFT. Again, this is a collectible, that should only be reserved if you love its illustration and only for fun.</p>
			<p><br></p>

			<p>&zwj;</p>
			<p>5. You assume all responsibility for any adverse effects of disruptions or other issues impacting Radix DLT Network, the Radix DLT Network platform or coding / programming error in relation to the NFTs.</p>

			<p><br></p>

In such cases the RADORABLES Team cannot be held liable.</p>

			<p>22. Conclusion</p>
			<p>You acknowledge and agree with all the above T&amp;C. You will only trade your RADORABLES NFT in accordance with the T&amp;Cs and only via a Radix NFT Marketplace (which is likely to have their own T&amp;Cs).</p>
			<p>As a responsible operator we remind you that:</p>
			<p>1) NFTs are not endorsed by any financial institution, nor government, nor are they regulated</p>
			<p>2) The NFT market is brand new, with no clear and stable expectations</p>
			<p>3) NFT ownership / trading is highly risky and is not suitable for most people</p>
			<p>4) Due to the formulation or modification of national laws, regulations and regulatory documents, digital asset transactions / ownership (including NFTs, Crypto, Radix, etc.) may be suspended or prohibited at any time</p>
