title: BUY RADORABLES
---
<br>
*WHITELIST SALE IS NOW OPEN - ONLY WHITELISTED WALLETS ARE ABLE TO RESERVE*<br>
*PUBLIC SALE STARTS ON DEC 29, 2022*<br>

In order to reserve a RADORABLES NFT, please carefully read and strictly follow the instructions below:<br>
<h3>Step 1.)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Decide how many RADORABLES you would like to purchase.<br>
Price per NFT:<br>
</p>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Whitelist Sale (max. 40 NFTs per wallet): 29 $XRD</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Public Sale (no limit per wallet - including wallets that have participated in the Whitelist Sale): 69 $XRD</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Alternatively, RADORABLES can be reserved with the $CRUMBS token. 1000 $CRUMBS = 1 NFT.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In case you have a whitelist spot, make sure to use the wallet which has been whitelisted. Not whitelisted wallets cannot buy during the Whitelist Sale.
All wallets that participated in the Whitelist Sale will also be able to purchase NFTs (unlimited amount) during the Public Sale starting on Dec 29, 2022.<br>
</p>
<h3>Step 2.)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Send $XRD or $CRUMBS from your personal wallet (NOT AN EXCHANGE wallet) in multiples depending on the amount of RADORABLES you wish to reserve. Important: Send the exact amount of $XRD / $CRUMBS, otherwise refunds & a fee occur. Examples:<br><br>
</p>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item active">During Whitelist Pre-Sale:</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">10 NFTs x 29 $XRD = 290 $XRD</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">40 NFTs x 29 $XRD = 1160 $XRD</li>
  <li class="list-group-item active">During Public Sale:</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">10 NFTs x 69 $XRD = 690 $XRD</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">50 NFTs x 69 $XRD = 3450 $XRD</li>
  <li class="list-group-item active">Reservation using $CRUMBS (possible during Whitelist + Public Sale)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">3 NFTs x 1000 $CRUMBS = 3000 $CRUMBS</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Important hint for Whitelist Sale:<br>
Please note that purchases made with $CRUMBS during the Whitelist Sale are also part of your maximum purchase of 40 NFTs. Example: If you send 1000 $CRUMBS for 1 RADORABLES NFT, you only have 39 NFTs left to buy for 29 XRD during Whitelist Sale.<br><br>
