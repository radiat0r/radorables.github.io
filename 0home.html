<p style="text-align: justify;">
  RADORABLES is a hand-drawn NFT collection on Radix. 10,000 lovable creatures have been hand-drawn by Vinny and come to live on the Radix Network with over 400 unique traits. During numerous hours of meticulous work, each feature has been crafted with love, care and an eye for detail. The goal was to create a high-quality and lasting monument on the Radix Network – by making sure that each Radorable has their unique identity and does justice to the phenomenal community.
  All artworks will be randomly assigned upon purchase. After purchase, you will receive one token per each of your randomly selected NFTs including its minting number to be able to look up your artwork on our website. <br><br>
  Once the Radix “Babylon” release has happened and Smart Contracts are enabled, you will be able to finally mint your RADORABLES. This is expected to happen in Q2 2023. The founders will retain a 10% royalty for each RADORABLES NFT traded on the secondary markets. 2.5% of the generated trading royalties will be periodically airdropped to all long-time RADORABLES holders.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
RADORABLES is more than just a regular NFT collection. To grant utility in the long run, we’ve established the CRUMBS token. Initially, our community was able to use the token to swap it for RADORABLES NFTs. Now, Chapter 2 has begun: A new CRUMBS token was born to serve as a governance token for our upcoming „Frens of the Crumbs” DAO. The new token will be airdropped to all RADORABLES holders monthly – a fixed amount per each NFT held. Alongside diverse DAO use cases, CRUMBS will also be listed on a DEX!
