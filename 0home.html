<div class="d-flex justify-content-left"><p class="h3"> Rad and adorable </p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  RADORABLES is a hand-drawn NFT collection on Radix. 10,000 lovable creatures have been hand-drawn by Vinny and come to live on the Radix Network with over 400 unique traits. During numerous hours of meticulous work, each feature has been crafted with love, care and an eye for detail. The goal was to create a high-quality and lasting monument on the Radix Network – by making sure that each Radorable has their unique identity and does justice to the phenomenal community.
  All artworks will be randomly assigned upon purchase. After purchase, you will receive one token per each of your randomly selected NFTs including its minting number to be able to look up your artwork on our website. <br><br>
  Once the Radix “Babylon” release has happened and Smart Contracts are enabled, you will be able to finally mint your RADORABLES. This is expected to happen in Q2 2023. The founders will retain a 10% royalty for each RADORABLES NFT traded on the secondary markets. 2.5% of the generated trading royalties will be periodically airdropped to all long-time RADORABLES holders.

<div class="d-flex justify-content-left"><p class="h3"> $CRUMBS Token</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
RADORABLES is more than just a regular NFT collection. To provide utility in the long run, the $CRUMBS token has been established. $CRUMBS serves as RADORABLES’ native currency and will be partially distributed to the community in the pre-sale period. 1000 $CRUMBS = 1 RADORABLE. After sellout, each $RADORABLE holder will be periodically airdropped $CRUMBS tokens, which will serve as an entry ticket to specials. These will include raffles, benefits in partnering projects and further utility purposes within the RADORABLES ecosystem. The total supply of $CRUMBS is 10,000,000.
